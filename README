The folder contains two main python files for color-coded data analysis.
- Ellipsoid.py generates the dendrogram and coordinate variation ellipsoid
- Cellcluster.py generates scatter plot for cell-based cluster visuallization

The files: cctable.dat, CLUSTERS.txt, manual_coordinate_146.txt are inputs of ellipsoid.py. Here we use height cutoff at 1.0 to get the output of the paper
The files: cell_base.cvs is the input of cellcluster.py
The program runs with python 3.8
